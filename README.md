When listing an item on Etsy the search algorithm relies on tags which the user can choose to apply to each product. 
This code will scrape the descriptions of existing products (similar to your own) and bring back the most used words in the descriptions of those items to then place in your tags.

This code was made for a friend selling on etsy but is intended for anyone to use. If anyone has suggestions on how to improve the code feel free to contact me.
